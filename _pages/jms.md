The Java Message Service (JMS) API is a Java Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) API for sending messages between two or more clients. It is a Java API that allows applications to create, send, receive, and read messages. The JMS API enables communication that is loosely coupled, asynchronous and reliable. The current version of the JMS specification is version 1.1.

The below links provide many step-by-step examples on how to use the Java Message Service API.

## Quick Start

A number of quick start examples for JMS:

JMS Hello World example
 A Java Message Server Hello World example that explains the basic JMS concepts. It uses the ActiveMQ JMS provider from Apache and offers a first look at sending and receiving messages.
    JMS Point-to-Point messaging example
    A point-to-point (PTP) product or application is built on the concept of message queues, senders and receivers.
    JMS Publish/Subscribe messaging example
    In a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) product or application, clients address messages to a topic, which functions somewhat like a bulletin board.
