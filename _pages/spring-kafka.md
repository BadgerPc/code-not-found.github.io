The [Spring for Apache Kafka (spring-kafka) project](https://projects.spring.io/spring-kafka/) applies core Spring concepts to the development of Kafka-based messaging solutions. It provides a 'template' as a high-level abstraction for sending messages. It also provides support for Message-driven POJOs with `@KafkaListener` annotations and a 'listener container'.
