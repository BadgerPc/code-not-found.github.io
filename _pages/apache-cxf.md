[Apache CXF](http://cxf.apache.org/) is an open source services framework. CXF helps to build and develop services using front end programming APIs like JAX-WS and JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP or RESTful HTTP and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP or JMS.

The below links provide many step-by-step examples on how to use the Apache CXF API.
