[Apache CXF](https://cxf.apache.org/) is an open source services framework. CXF helps to build and develop services using front end programming APIs like JAX-WS and JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP or RESTful HTTP and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP or JMS. The following tutorial illustrates a basic example in which we will configure, build and run a Hello World contract first client and web service using CXF, Spring , Maven and Jetty. 

> An updated version of this blog post has been created in which the [Hello World CXF SOAP service is created using Spring JavaConfig and Spring Boot]({{ site.url }}/2016/10/cxf-soap-web-service-consumer-provider-wsdl-example.html).

Tools used:
* CXF 3.1
* Spring 4.3
* Maven 3
* Jetty 9

A web service can be developed using one of two approaches:
1. **Start with a WSDL contract** and generate Java objects to implement the service.
2. **Start with a Java object** and service enable it using annotations.
