Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented. It was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

Java is currently owned by the Oracle Corporation which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010. Following tutorial will show you how to setup and configure Java 1.6 on your Windows computer so you can develop and run Java code.

# JDK Download & Install

Java can be downloaded from the [Oracle Java download page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). There are a number of different download packages available, for this tutorial we will be installing Java Standard Edition (SE) on Windows. In order to be able to compile Java code we need the Java Development Kit (JDK) package that comes with a Java compiler. The JDK package also comes with a Java runtime environment (JRE) that is needed to run compiled Java code.

For this tutorial we will use an older Java version which can be obtained by scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the page and clicking on the [Previous Releases - Java Archive link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/archive-139210.html). Look for the <var>Java SE 6</var> link and after clicking on it select <var>Java SE Development Kit 6u45</var>.

> You can find here the direct link to [download the jdk1.6.0_45 installer for windows 32 or 64 bit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html#jdk-6u45-oth-JPR).

Accept the License Agreement and pick the correct download for your operating system. In this example we will use the Windows 64 bit version.
