[HermesJMS](http://hermesjms.com/) is a graphical user interface that helps you interact with with many of the popular JMS providers. It allows to publish and edit messages, browse or search queues and topics, copy messages around and delete them. Hermes JMS is an open source project hosted by [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hermesjms/). Following tutorial shows how to install Hermes JMS on Windows or Unix and perform a start/stop of the application. 

In this guide we will be covering following steps:
* Prerequisite & Downloading the Installer
* Installation Procedure for Windows & Unix
* Startup & Exit on Windows
* Startup & Exit on Unix
* Changing the Default Configuration Location on Windows
* Changing the Default Configuration File on Unix

# Prerequisites & Downloading the Installer

Hermes JMS is written in Java. It needs [a Java runtime environment (JRE) of version 1.6 or higher to be installed and configured](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (with JAVA_HOME correctly set). If you are not sure what Java version is installed on your machine, open a console and executed following command:

``` plaintext
java -version
```

Let's get started by downloading the HermesJMS installer Java archive (JAR). Go the the [HermesJMS download page](http://www.hermesjms.com/confluence/display/HJMS/Home) and click on the Sourceforge link in the <ins>Downloading and Webstarting</ins> section. This will redirect to a Sourceforge page, click on the '<var>hermes-installer-X.XX.jar</var>' link and download the JAR file. Seeing as Hermes JMS is written in Java, the installer will run on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

> Update: it looks like the HermesJMS home page is currently not available. You can however still [download the latest stable release: 'hermes-installer-1.14.jar' from SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hermesjms/files/hermesjms/1.14/hermes-installer-1.14.jar/download).
