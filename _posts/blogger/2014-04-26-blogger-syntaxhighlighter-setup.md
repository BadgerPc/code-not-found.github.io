Blogger, the blog-publishing service from Google, does not provide a syntax highlighter out of the box. This means you need to resort to third party solutions in order to have syntax highlighting in your posts. One of those solutions is the syntax highlighter created by Alex Gorbatchev which is called [SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/).

One of the advantages of this highlighter is that it is purely written in JavaScript and as a result it does not need a server side component. SyntaxHighlighter can be easily integrated into your Blogger blog as we will detail in this tutorial.
