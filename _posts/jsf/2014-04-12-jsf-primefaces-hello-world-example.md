PrimeFaces is an open source component library for JavaServer Faces (JSF). It provides a collection of mostly visual components (widgets) that can be used by JSF programmers to build the UI for a web application. An overview of these widgets can be found at the PrimeFaces showcase. In the following tutorial we will configure, build and run a Hello World PrimeFaces example using Jetty and Maven.
