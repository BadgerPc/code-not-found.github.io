[Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/), is an open-source web server developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It implements several Java EE specifications and provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment for Java code to run in. Tomcat is released under Apache License 2.0, and is open-source software.

The following post illustrates a basic example in which we will configure, build and run a Hello World PrimeFaces example using Tomcat and Maven.

Tools used:
* JSF 2.2
* PrimeFaces 6.0
* Tomcat 7
* Maven 3
